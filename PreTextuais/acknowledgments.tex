First of all, I would like to thank Dr. Donald E. Knuth for developing \TeX.

To Dr. Leslie Lamport, for creating \LaTeX, greatly facilitating the use of \TeX, and thus, saving me from having to use Word.

To Prof. Dr. My Advisor, for the guidance and trust placed in the completion of this work.

To Dr. Nelson D'Ávilla, for lending his name to this important road in the city of São José dos Campos.

Oh, I almost forgot... I also thank \TeX, once again, for not having macro viruses :-)
